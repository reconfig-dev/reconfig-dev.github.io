## Hi, I'm Syed!

I was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A very sweet place, has very beautiful rains and 2-3 hour long traffic jams. I was there for the majority of my childhood and teenage years. In 2011, I moved to Kolkata, India to complete my Grade 11 and 12. Life there was quite dynamic and the place turned out to be very enriching for my personal development. Kolkata gave me life long friends and bitter and sweet memories. After Kolkata, I moved to Rochester, NY, USA and completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology. I spent a little more than a year at NVIDIA as a Software Engineer and contributed to PyTorch. I have recently finished my Master's
in Electrical Engineering from UPenn and am looking forward to further
my engineering career in the HW/SW industry.

Academically, I love to investigate high performance computing, machine intelligence, digital logic design, compilers and cryptography. Sounds too nerdy? Here are some more things – I love singing, playing the guitar, piano, percussion, philosophy, poetry, travelling, reflecting, sleeping, criticizing, eating, observing people’s face and a lot of other things that you can discover about me if we ever spend some time together.
